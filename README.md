# Express Engine

A very basic game engine.
So far you can basically only create a window and barely draw a triangle.
It's just a project I started for fun.

To use this repository:
clone this repository using the command:
'git clone --recursive https://github.com/Ggjorven/Express-Engine.git'

when that's finished op the .sln file with Visual Studio.
Right click on the 'Sandbox' project and click 'Set as startup project'.

Now you're ready to build!

You could also clone the repository without the '--recursive' command,
one thing to note about that^ is that you have to add the submodules yourself, so not very useful.

Thanks for reading!
