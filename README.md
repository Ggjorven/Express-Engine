# Express Engine

A very basic game engine.
So far you can basically only create a window and barely draw a triangle.
It's just a project I started for fun.

To clone this repository use the command:
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Ggjorven/Express-Engine.git
--

You could also clone the repository without the '--recursive' command,
one thing to note about that is that you have to add the submodules yourself, so not very useful.

Thanks for reading!
